Hit: Take another card from the dealer.&#x0a;&#x0d;
Stand: Take no more cards; also known as stand pat, stick, or stay.&#x0a;&#x0d;
Double down The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet.&#x0a;&#x0d;
Split (only available as first decision of a hand): If the first two cards have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box of the original bet.
The dealer separates the two cards and draws a further card on each, placing one bet with each hand. 
The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn, with some restrictions.&#x0a;&#x0d;
Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of T-T may be split, but not of T-K. However, usually all ten-value cards are treated the same.
Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and blackjacks after a split are counted as non-blackjack 21 when comparing against the dealer's hand. 
Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. "/>
